script provides the functionality you requested. Here's a breakdown of its features:

1. It checks if ipmitool is installed and accessible.
2. It accepts command-line arguments for the IPMI IP address, action to perform, username, and password.
3. It can perform two actions:
4.   a. Power cycle the server
5.   b. Set PXE boot for the next reboot
6. It uses subprocess to run IPMI commands securely.

To use the script, you can run it from the command line like this:
```
python ipmi_management.py <ip_address> <action> -u <username> -p <password>
python ipmi_management.py 192.168.1.100 power_cycle -u ADMIN -p mypassword
python ipmi_management.py 192.168.1.100 set_pxe -u ADMIN -p mypassword
```
